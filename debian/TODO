devtodo - hierarchical task list- Fix situation where doing "todo -r -5" goes into an endless loop.
  (added Sun Oct 14 17:03:55 2001, incomplete, priority veryhigh)

- Fix problems with * expansion. It doesn't appear to work at all...
  (added Thu Oct 31 15:53:21 2002, incomplete, priority veryhigh)

- Change everything to be an attribute (except, perhaps, the item body). This
  will allow things like timers and so forth (eg. todo --add-attrib 'start=%D').
  (added Tue May 22 20:12:48 2001, incomplete, priority high)

  - Timed events. eg. todo --set text="This is funny"@07/03/2001-10:53 12 ...
    this would change the text of item 12 to "This is funny" on the 07/03/2001
    at 10:53 in the morning.
    (added Wed May  9 13:44:24 2001, incomplete, priority veryhigh)

- Add new filter options 'created=<date>[-<date>|,<date>]',
  'completed=<date>[-<date>|,<date>]' and 'duration=<time>' to filtering code.
  (added Fri Apr 13 20:38:59 2001, incomplete, priority medium)

- Add a 'current' marker to items? ie. mark the item you are currently working
  on so that it is easier to determine.
  (added Fri Apr 13 21:02:46 2001, incomplete, priority medium)

- Adding optional "hidden" notes to notes. Kind of like annotations. Invoke an
  external editor for this facility? (idea courtesy of Alexei Gilchrist).
  (added Wed Apr 18 02:45:20 2001, incomplete, priority medium)

- Add encryption using crash::Encrypt classes. This will probably require MIME
  support, or something similar, in order to actually store the resultant binary
  information.
  (added Thu Apr 19 23:20:14 2001, incomplete, priority medium)

  - Alternatively, just pass the encryption stream to the database saving
    routine. This would require rewriting the Loaders interface (again).
    (added Sat Apr 21 21:42:59 2001, incomplete, priority medium)

- Add per-database options - brilliant for changing views on different
  databases.
  (added Fri Apr 20 01:35:07 2001, incomplete, priority medium)

  - Problem with this is that the options are parsed *before* the database is
    loaded, which would probably mean reloading the database to have the new
    options take effect.
    (added Tue Apr 24 02:26:04 2001, incomplete, priority medium)

- Add percentage completions?
  (added Mon Apr 30 00:38:53 2001, incomplete, priority medium)

- i18n support?
  (added Mon Apr 30 00:58:59 2001, incomplete, priority medium)

- Rewrite filtering code so it's generic (as the sorting code is).
  (added Tue May  1 16:36:22 2001, incomplete, priority medium)

- Write functions to do envar expansion, C string escaping, etc.
  (added Sun May  6 16:30:08 2001, incomplete, priority medium)

- Categories - optionally assign a note a category, then you can filter on that
  category.
  (added Thu Oct  4 16:00:52 2001, incomplete, priority medium)

- Make priority names and number of them user-defineable.
  (added Tue Oct  9 04:20:23 2001, incomplete, priority medium)

- Some sort of integration with CVS would be cool. Maybe you could do: "todo
  --cvs-commit" and it would commit to CVS using all the completed TODO items
  since the last commit as the change notes. That would be exceptionally cool.
  (added Wed Apr 18 03:17:45 2001, incomplete, priority low)

- Evaluate filters on first use rather than on read. This will allow wildcard
  filters to actually work.
  (added Wed Jul  4 22:49:30 2001, incomplete, priority low)

- Add facility to extract TODO entries in source code into .todo database.
  Perhaps an external script or something would be better?
  (added Sun Jan 28 02:23:56 2001, incomplete, priority verylow)

  - Could be done with an option to the root node, such as: <todo mirror="true">
    (added Sun Jan 28 02:23:56 2001, incomplete, priority verylow)

- Minor bug where items with sub-items that are all marked done still get a +
  when children are filtered out.
  (added Sun Jan 28 02:23:56 2001, incomplete, priority verylow)
